# 🌥️ CloudTasks - A Simple To-Do List App

CloudTasks is a minimal and user-friendly to-do list web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to add, mark, and remove tasks easily — and most importantly, it remembers your tasks even after refreshing or closing the browser using **localStorage**.

### 🗒️ Task Note-Taking App Update

> This task note-taking app runs directly in a browser tab and stores all data locally using the browser’s local storage.  

- 💾 Notes remain saved even after refreshing the page.
- 🔒 Data persists within the same browser tab.
- 🧹 All stored data is removed only when the browser cache for that tab is cleared.
